Here is a SQL query with Subquery for how many films are rated G, PG, or PG-13, and how many films are less than 100-minutes long

SELECT COUNT(shortmovies.film_ID) AS short_movie_count,
       shortmovies.rating
FROM
  (SELECT film.film_ID,
          film.rating
   FROM film
   WHERE film.length <=100) AS shortmovies -- subquery renamed shortmovies
WHERE shortmovies.rating IN ('G', 'PG', 'PG-13')   
GROUP BY shortmovies.rating;
